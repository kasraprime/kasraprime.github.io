      <description>There has been great hype in multimodal research these past few days because of the release of multiple text-to-video models while text-to-image models are still pretty hype and not perfect yet. Diffusion models such as GLIDE in general and stable diffusion in particular are the state-of-the-art models for text-to-image tasks as of now. However, multiple papers came out recently that tackle the task of generating videos from text prompts or still images.</description>

      <description>Some Announcement I am back at writing again. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I still write everyday, but for myself, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time that I have not written anything publicly. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s about to change since I have some ideas to write about frequently. The theme of my frequent writings are the followings:
Research Paper Summaries Journals and Diary Book Summaries and Recommendations Research Paper Summaries The papers are going to be mostly in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, but I might write about other fields occasionally; these other areas could be Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, and more.</description>

      <description>Hey You Perfectionist Don&amp;rsquo;t spend endless hours contemplating the tools. Follow this rule:
As long as you have access to your data and they are palin text, you will be fine. The worst is that you can&amp;rsquo;t convert your files easily to another plain text format, but even in that case you can search your files and find the data you are looking for. Don&amp;rsquo;t think about publishing and making it look good, because notes evolve over time and you don&amp;rsquo;t want the pdfs of them you created two years ago.</description>

      <description>Who Am I what I do? Am I what I like? Am I just my name? Am I my income? Am I the number of people who love me?
Maybe, but none of them describe me completely. I&amp;rsquo;m defined by the moments that I laughed my a** off, the moments that I cried so hard, the moments that I made someone smile, the moments that I helped someone, the moments that I needed to be helped, the moments that I loved others, the moments that I learned something.</description>

      <description>In this post, I am going to talk about the process of applying for universities in United States of America, but most of the parts are general and applicable to other countries as well. I am assuming that you are an undergrad or Master&amp;rsquo;s student and want to apply for Master&amp;rsquo;s or Ph.D. degree. Before starting to apply for universities, you need to have a reasonable resume, which means you have to learn different skills and have some research experiences in your field of study.</description>

You can alternatively use the command org-insert-link or keyborad shortcut spc m l l. The default keybinding is C-c C-l.</description>
