      <description>Generative AI models are a broad area in Machine Learning that instead of Classification focus on creating data. Classification is about prediction which is really cool; Nostradamus ;) However, the ability to create is superior; We become Gods, new kind of gods that really exist! Also, if you can create, you can predict.
With that introduction, we can jump into the edge of research in this field. This field is growing really fast and has gained a lot of attention from the public and media recently, especially the famous ChatGpt model by OpenAI.</description>
