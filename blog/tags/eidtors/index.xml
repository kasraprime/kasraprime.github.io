      <description>Hey You Perfectionist Don&amp;rsquo;t spend endless hours contemplating the tools. Follow this rule:
As long as you have access to your data and they are palin text, you will be fine. The worst is that you can&amp;rsquo;t convert your files easily to another plain text format, but even in that case you can search your files and find the data you are looking for. Don&amp;rsquo;t think about publishing and making it look good, because notes evolve over time and you don&amp;rsquo;t want the pdfs of them you created two years ago.</description>
