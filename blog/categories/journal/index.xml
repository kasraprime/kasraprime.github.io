      <description>Some Announcement I am back at writing again. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I still write everyday, but for myself, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time that I have not written anything publicly.

 Research Paper Summaries Journals and Diary Book Summaries and Recommendations  Research Paper Summaries The papers are going to be mostly in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, but I might write about other fields occasionally; these other areas could be Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, and more.</description>
