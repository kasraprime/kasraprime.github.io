      <description>Generative AI models are a broad area in Machine Learning that instead of Classification focus on creating data. Classification is about prediction which is really cool; Nostradamus ;) However, the ability to create is superior; We become Gods, new kind of gods that really exist! Also, if you can create, you can predict.
With that introduction, we can jump into the edge of research in this field. This field is growing really fast and has gained a lot of attention from the public and media recently, especially the famous ChatGpt model by OpenAI.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Video AI Models: A New Hype in Multimodal Machine Learning</title>

      <description>There has been great hype in multimodal research these past few days because of the release of multiple text-to-video models while text-to-image models are still pretty hype and not perfect yet. Diffusion models such as GLIDE in general and stable diffusion in particular are the state-of-the-art models for text-to-image tasks as of now. However, multiple papers came out recently that tackle the task of generating videos from text prompts or still images.</description>
