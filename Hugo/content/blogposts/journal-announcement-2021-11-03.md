# Some Announcement
I am back at writing again. Don't get me wrong, I still write everyday, but for myself, and it's been a long time that I have not written anything publicly.
Well, that's about to change since I have some ideas to write about frequently.
The theme of my frequent writings are the followings:

1. Research Paper Summaries
2. Journals and Diary 
3. Book Summaries and Recommendations

## Research Paper Summaries
The papers are going to be mostly in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, but I might write about other fields occasionally; these other areas could be Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, and more.
These posts and summaries are going to be technical. However, I plan to write non-technical posts about some of these papers or about an idea that is inspired by these papers and connecting them to other ideas. The non-technical posts will either end up as a section in journals (I have to find a better name for them; how about primal?) or in a topic dedicated to that idea as a its own separate post.  

### The Hierarchy
There will be a hub page which lists all papers that I summarize. This page acts as a control center or a *hub* if you may. I provide very short summaries for every paper here (about 2 sentences). The detailed summaries will be in a different post dedicated to each paper.
However, not all papers in this page are going to be summarized in detail. Therefore, if you see one paper has a link that you can click on, it means I have summarized that paper in more depth, otherwise the short summary you see in the *hub* page is everything that I have written about that paper so far. Note that the status of papers may change as I might read them in more depth in the future.

### The Structure
For detailed summaries, I will have a fixed structure to facilitate reading for you. This structure is also changing over time as I gain more experience and hear your feedbacks hopefully! As of right now the structure includes the following sections:
1. Up to five keywords
2. A summary consisting of about 200-300 words
3. Terminology
4. My thoughts on the paper
5. Key takeaways, or rather a summary in the form of bullet points


## Journals
These kind of posts will usually be short and all over the place. The title will be just the date.
The purpose of these posts is to share the the material(s), resource(s), and the thoughts that I have about a subject as quickly as possible without getting too deep in the matter, and without thinking about a title for it. If I start to think of a title, then that post should be about one concept only, and if it's only a few sentences, I would not publish it until I make it perfect. However, if I write whatever I have in mind as a diary/journal post, then at least I will do it.
Right now I'm using the date of publication as the tile for this type of posts. But I am thinking of having 1 diary/journal post per year, and edit the same post and add a new section whenever I want to write a new entry.
Please let me know which one is more useful; new posts per journal, or one post per year that gets updated?
