      <description>In this post, I am going to talk about the process of applying for universities in United States of America, but most of the parts are general and applicable to other countries as well. I am assuming that you are an undergrad or Master&amp;rsquo;s student and want to apply for Master&amp;rsquo;s or Ph.D. degree. Before starting to apply for universities, you need to have a reasonable resume, which means you have to learn different skills and have some research experiences in your field of study.</description>
